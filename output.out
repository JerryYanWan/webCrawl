Iraq’s armed forces recaptured Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province, which fell to Islamic State in May and is just 100km from Baghdad. The country’s prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, said that IS would be driven from his country by the end of 2016. IS also suffered fresh reverses in Syria; on December 26th it lost the important power-generating Tishreen dam to a mainly Kurdish force.

In the middle of 2015 Brent crude was trading at $65 a barrel; now it is under $38. An outbreak of Ebola that rampaged through three African countries officially ended when the World Health Organisation declared that Guinea was free of the disease. The outbreak, which started two years ago, killed some 11,000 people, most of them in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Stockmarkets responded positively to the Federal Reserve’s decision on December 16th to raise interest rates for the first time since 2006. After months of dithering the central bank lifted the range for its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point to between 0.25% and 0.5%. Martin Shkreli was arrested by the FBI on December 17th and charged with securities fraud. Mr Shkreli made the headlines in 2015 when a drugs company he ran bought the rights to a medicine and raised its price by 5,000%. The (unrelated) charges against Mr Shkreli, which he denies, pertain to his time as a hedge-fund manager. Poland’s right-wing government passed a law requiring the constitutional court to approve decisions by a two-thirds majority, and with at least 13 of the 15 judges present. The law will force the court to accept disputed new judges whom the government has appointed. It will also make it much harder to strike down new laws. The opposition staged furious demonstrations. See article.  Spain held an election before Christmas, which resulted in no stable majority. The ruling People’s Party of Mariano Rajoy came first and the Socialists second. Two smaller parties took seats, breaking the traditional two-party system. Brazil’s finance minister, Joaquim Levy, resigned on December 18th. He came into office in January 2015 with a mandate to slash the budget deficit but was thwarted by a severe recession and political turmoil. His successor is Nelson Barbosa, who was the planning minister. A group of Central American countries plus Mexico reached an agreement to allow some of the 7,000 migrants from Cuba who are stuck on Costa Rica’s border with Nicaragua to travel to the United States. Nicaragua had blocked their entry. The migrants will now be airlifted to El Salvador and continue by bus. The number of migrants from Cuba has increased since a diplomatic thaw with the United States began in 2014. Many fear that the rapprochement will end the United States’ policy of accepting émigrés from Cuba if they reach American soil. Argentina lifted exchange controls and allowed the peso to float freely, days after the inauguration of its new president, Mauricio Macri. This forms part of a liberalisation programme to reverse populist policies of the outgoing government of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. See article.  Carlos Rosales Mendoza, the founder of La Familia Michoacana, a Mexican drug gang, was found dead along with the bodies of three other people near a motorway in western Mexico. He was on the most-wanted list of the Drug Enforcement Agency in the United States. A landslide in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen killed seven people and left dozens of others missing. Officials called it an “industrial safety accident”, caused by a collapsing heap of construction waste. An official who had once overseen the site committed suicide. The chairman of one of China’s largest state-owned mobile operators, China Telecom, is being investigated by anti-graft officials. The businessman, Chang Xiaobing, is among several senior executives who have been targeted in an anti- corruption campaign being waged by President Xi Jinping. Japan and South Korea agreed to settle a long-standing dispute over women forced to work in Japanese brothels during the second world war. Japan apologised and said it would pay ¥1 billion ($8.3m) to help victims. The bodies of six American troops killed by a Taliban suicide-bomber near Bagram air base in Afghanistan were flown home. It was the deadliest attack on American personnel in the country in years. A sizeable contingent of troops is to remain in Afghanistan until at least the start of 2017. The season of goodwill extended to America’s House of Representatives, which passed a $1.8 trillion spending measure before Christmas with little argument and thus avoided a government shutdown. Paul Ryan, the new Speaker, was commended for his adroit handling of the bill.

AT THE start of 2016 Brazil should be in an exuberant mood. Rio de Janeiro is to host South America’s first Olympic games in August, giving Brazilians a chance to embark on what they do best: throwing a really spectacular party. Instead, Brazil faces political and economic disaster. On December 16th Fitch became the second of the three big credit-rating agencies to downgrade Brazil’s debt to junk status. Days later Joaquim Levy, the finance minister appointed by the president, Dilma Rousseff, to stabilise the public finances, quit in despair after less than a year in the job. Brazil’s economy is predicted to shrink by 2.5-3% in 2016, not much less than it did in 2015. Even oil-rich, sanction-racked Russia stands to do better. At the same time, Brazil’s governing coalition has been discredited by a gargantuan bribery scandal surrounding Petrobras, a state-controlled oil company. And Ms Rousseff, accused of hiding the size of the budget deficit, faces impeachment proceedings in Congress. As the B in BRICS, Brazil is supposed to be in the vanguard of fast-growing emerging economies. Instead it faces political dysfunction and perhaps a return to rampant inflation. Only hard choices can put Brazil back on course. Just now, Ms Rousseff does not seem to have the stomach for them. Dismal Dilma Brazil’s suffering, like that of other emerging economies, stems partly from the fall in global commodity prices. But Ms Rousseff and her left-wing Workers’ Party (PT) have made a bad situation much worse. During her first term, in 2011-14, she spent extravagantly and unwisely on higher pensions and unproductive tax breaks for favoured industries. The fiscal deficit swelled from 2% of GDP in 2010 to 10% in 2015. Brazil’s crisis managers do not have the luxury of waiting for better times to begin reform (see article). At 70% of GDP, public debt is worryingly large for a middle-income country and rising fast. Because of high interest rates, the cost of servicing it is a crushing 7% of GDP. The Central Bank cannot easily use monetary policy to fight inflation, currently 10.5%, as higher rates risk destabilising the public finances even more by adding to the interest bill. Brazil therefore has little choice but to raise taxes and cut spending. Mr Levy made a game attempt to renovate the building while putting out the fire. He trimmed discretionary spending by a record 70 billion reais ($18 billion) in 2015 and tightened eligibility for unemployment insurance. But it was not enough. The recession dragged down tax revenues. Ms Rousseff gave her finance minister only lukewarm support and the PT was hostile towards him. The opposition, intent on ousting the president, was in no mood to co-operate. Although he was a senior treasury official during Ms Rousseff’s disastrous first term, Nelson Barbosa may be able to accomplish more as finance minister. He has political support within the PT. He also has bargaining power, because Ms Rousseff cannot afford to lose another finance minister. One early test will be whether Mr Barbosa persuades a recalcitrant Congress to reinstate an unpopular financial-transactions tax. A central target should be pensions. The minimum benefit is the same as the minimum
